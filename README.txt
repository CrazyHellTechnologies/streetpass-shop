You can download all the StreetPass data you can dream of in our UniStore!

Our current dataset is based on the Google Drive link on page 8 of the StreetPass 2.0 Rise from the ashes thread on GBATemp, and a few other contributers.

HOSTING:

#FAQ
- I don't make YouTube videos. I make Odysee exclusive content.
- I don't have the need too. A wiki works, but I don't have the time for it atm.
- It's all self explanatory, read the description for the godmode9 script in the shop, or look through the chatlogs here. I'm willing to aid, but I'm not going to make a video over it.
